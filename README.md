# DCL Escrow dApp

Our decentralized application allows for trustless, off-market transactions of DCL land tokens.

We mirrored our smart contract to reflect the current marketplace contract and we DO NOT hold your Mana & Land tokens.

## Functionality
- Select a single parcel or multiple parcels to sell off-market
- Set a custom price for your escrow
- Restrict escrow access to a specific wallet address

## Security
- Our smart contract only handles your Mana & Land tokesn once both parties have agreed to the escrow
- Our smart contract creates a unique escrow id and stores the asset id(s) of the parcel(s) to be transferred
- You will always maintain control of your Mana & Land - the contract NEVER holds your tokens
- Our smart contract utilizes the safeTransfer() method to ensure the receipient address can accept ERC-721 tokens
- View our Verified Contract on Etherscan https://etherscan.io/address/0x8180F8836BF47970225Fe96C1c2FBef6697B3223
